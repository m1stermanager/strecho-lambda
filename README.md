# strecho-lambda

Ask alexa about your strava activities. 

## current support
* users can login to strava via the amazon-alexa app (not seen in this repo yet)
* users can ask alexa/echo: "ask strava how i did today" and get a summary of their activities.
* running, biking, and swimming are currently supported.

## next steps
* ~transform the hello world version into something that just grabs my last strava activity and tells me how great I am~
* start asking for summaries of things like "how am i doing this week" "how did i do last week" etc. 
* if the strava api allows.... update activities in a smart way.... tell strava which pair of shoes I ran in and update the activity, give activities names and descriptions.... read the comments that people have left on my activities
* if it is possible w/ the strava api receive my notifications and actually have the echo do the little "red ring" thing to tell me that i have a notification
