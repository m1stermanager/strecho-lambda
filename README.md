# strecho-lambda

currently this is just a project for me figuring out a pleasant way to interact w/ amazon echo stuff. There is a fairly annoying and complex schema i need to use so I'm going to try to make a few helpful sub packages that can do really dumb simple stuff and build from there

## next steps
once we have the dumb "hello world" version of everything i want to 
* transform the hello world version into something that just grabs my last strava activity and tells me how great I am
* start asking for summaries of things like "how am i doing this week" "how did i do last week" etc. 
* if the strava api allows.... update activities in a smart way.... tell strava which pair of shoes I ran in and update the activity, give activities names and descriptions.... read the comments that people have left on my activities
* if it is possible w/ the strava api receive my notifications and actually have the echo do the little "red ring" thing to tell me that i have a notification
